# How to Run

This project contains support to be compiled and run using the Gradle tool. To do this, you will need to be sure you have Gradle installed on your machine. You can do this by [downloading the zip file from this link](https://gradle.org/install/) and following the instructions on the page.

After you have Gradle installed, open your computer's terminal or command prompt. Navigate to where you have the project folder saved, then navigate inside the /Legend-of-Nine/LegendOfNine directories. You should then be able to compile the project using the `gradle` command.

After compilation is finished, the game window can be launched using the command `gradle run`.

Advice for common issues with Gradle:

- Ensure tools.jar is visible in your Java installation folder. This may require installing JDK8 and moving the tools.jar file from the lib directory into your JRE's lib directory.
- Ensure Gradle is visible on your build path, and its file location is set in your computer's environmental variables.
