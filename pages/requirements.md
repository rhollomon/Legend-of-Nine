# Requirements Specification for Legend of Nine

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of Product

The purpose of this project is to develop an understanding of game creation as well as use that understanding to further our knowledge in software development. Our group stives to create an interactive game experience that allows players to easily pickup our game and complete it while also having fun. As new game developers, our audience is preferably people with little video game experience. This will allow our team to take feedback and turn it into meaningful results so that people who are unfamiliar with games can have a good experience with what we create. Overall, the product we develop will allow us to form a foundation for something we all enjoy doing and will hopefully lead into future opportunities surrounding the same field of interest. 

### 1.2 Scope of Product
